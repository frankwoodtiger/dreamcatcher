Question Practice App For Naturalization

This is a question practice application. It uses Spring Boot as its backend framework specifically using
Spring Data REST to expose its data endpoint for read, write, update, etc. It is just back by a H2 Database with its 
default basic authentication enabled for the H2 console

For the frontend, it uses React.js to drive the user interaction.
